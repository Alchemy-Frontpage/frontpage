Super clean, modular code--I kind of don't have a lot of refactoring to offer, since everything here seems about as good as it can get, given the limitations of component architechure: it looks like y'all made decisions with readability and scalability in mind. I guess the only thing I'd like to see is even more stretch goals, more features, more complexity. I feel like since this code is so good, with some planning and risk-taking, y'all could have achieved something more special. As it is, this is nonetheless an impressive accomplishment and a mark of all the amazing effort y'all have put in over the past few months :)
